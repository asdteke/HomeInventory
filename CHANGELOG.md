# Changelog

All notable changes to HomeInventory are documented here.

## v2.0.0 - Redesigned Release

HomeInventory v2.0.0 is a major product refresh of the open-source household inventory app. It keeps the same privacy-first, self-hostable direction while rebuilding large parts of the user experience and hardening critical flows.

### Highlights

- Redesigned the main React experience across the landing page, app shell, dashboard, inventory, settings, auth, admin, legal, QR, and Personal Vault surfaces.
- Improved household-scoped security around backups, borrowing, private items, stale sessions, OAuth state, and account lockout behavior.
- Expanded and cleaned localization coverage with 100+ UI locale packs, fallback behavior, and legal translation checks.
- Refined HomeInventory PWA assets with light/dark icons, browser metadata, and updated GitHub-facing screenshots.
- Added stronger tests for auth, vault, borrowing privacy, legal translations, SQLite date handling, TOTP, and security-hardening flows.
- Improved local development startup output and release validation.

### Upgrade Notes

- Review `.env.example` and `README_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` before deploying. Production instances must keep strong `JWT_SECRET`, `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID` values.
- Run the normal production build after pulling this release: `npm run build`.
- Back up SQLite data and uploads before upgrading a self-hosted production deployment.
- If you maintain custom branding, review the new files under `client/public/brand` and `client/public/pwa`.

## v1.0.0 - Initial Stable Baseline

The v1.0.0 line established the original stable HomeInventory baseline: multi-house inventory management, QR/barcode workflows, Docker self-hosting, authentication, backups, encryption-at-rest support, and multilingual UI foundations.
